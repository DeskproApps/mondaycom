Next, navigate to the "OAuth" section in the side menu. Here, you will need to configure the necessary permissions for your app. In the "Scopes" drawer, select the following scopes: `me:read`, `boards:read`, `boards:write`, `users:read`, `workspaces:read`, `updates:read`, and `updates:write`. These permissions ensure that your app can access the required data from monday.com while maintaining security and control over what it can modify.
